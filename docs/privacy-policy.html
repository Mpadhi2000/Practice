              <h4>Lawful Bases of processing your Personal Data   </h4>
              <p>
                We process your Personal Data by relying on one or more of the
                following lawful bases:

                <li>

                </li>

                <li>
                  The processing is necessary for the performance of the
                  contract we have with you or to take steps to enter
                  a contract with you. 
                </li>

                <li>

                Where the processing is based on your consent, you
                have the right to withdraw your consent at any point
                in time. Please note that should the withdrawal of consent
                result in us not being able to continue offering our products
                and services to you, we reserve the right to withdraw or cease
                our products and services to you upon your withdrawal. You may
                withdraw consent by contacting us with a written request to the
                contact details specified below in the ‘Contact Us’
                section. Upon receipt of your request to withdraw your
                consent, the consequences of withdrawal will be communicated
